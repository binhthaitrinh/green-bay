## Phu Quoc Airport

Phu Quoc International Airport is conveniently placed on the island just a few kilometres away from the major tourist attractions such as Long Beach, and it puts you within easy reach of anywhere on the island. Expanding its flight schedule in recent years to meet demand, it is now Vietnam’s fifth largest airport, with dozens of flights arriving each day from both Vietnam and beyond.

Due to Phu Quoc’s increasing popularity, the airport now offers direct flights to and from a wide range of international destinations such as London, Milan, Moscow, Copenhagen and Stockholm in Europe (within season), as well as from Asian countries closer to home such as China, Thailand, Myanmar, Malaysia, South Korea and Hong Kong.

As with most major airports, there are a variety of ATMs when you touch down for if you need some holiday spending money, where you can withdraw from both domestic and international banks. If you’re staying with a resort such as Green Bay, they can arrange for transport to meet you at the airport, or alternatively there are a plethora of taxi services at the airport terminal to choose from.

## Ho Chi Minh to Phu Quoc

Most people traveling to Phu Quoc will be doing so from Ho Chi Minh City, also known as Saigon. As the most populous city in the country, it’s a transport hub that connects the wider world to Vietnam via Tan Son Nhat International Airport. The airport is also situated very close to the city centre, much more so than most other major cities, which makes taxi rides cheap and quick. Frequent flights are scheduled daily to Phu Quoc from its domestic terminal, running almost every hour from sunrise into the night. You can take your pick from your preferred airline companies, with VietJet, Jetstar, Vietnam Airlines and Hahn Air all regularly flying from Saigon to Phu Quoc.

With a flight time of just one hour, it’s quick, simple and the easiest way to get to Phu Quoc. It’s also remarkably cheap, with prices as low as $40 each way.

## Hanoi to Phu Quoc

Those stationed in Hanoi are also spoilt for choice when it comes to Phu Quoc flights. Noi Bai International Airport has a huge range of daily flights heading there direct from numerous airline companies, and with only a two-hour flight time traveling from North Vietnam right the way down south, it’s an effortless journey for holidaymakers who need to make the trip.

## Phu Quoc Ferry

While arriving by air is the quickest and simplest method of transport for most, there is the option of arriving by boat for those who want a more scenic introduction to the island. Phu Quoc has a number of ferries arriving daily to the island from Rach Gia or Ha Tien towns on the mainland. There are a number of ‘fast ferry’ options by four different companies: Ngoc Tanh, Superdong, Thanh Thoi the Phu Quoc Express, with Superdong being the most popular and highly-rated option, with the boats well-serviced and in excellent condition. All ferries into Phu Quoc arrive at the Bai Vong port.

Those wishing to bring their own motorbike or bicycle to Phu Quoc will be pleased to know that the ferry companies can accommodate them for a modest extra fee.

## Phu Quoc Taxis

For guests staying at Green Bay Resort, we offer the option of airport pickups to make your stay hassle-free from the moment you arrive. However, if you’re staying at another resort or hotel, or haven’t had any transport arrangements booked for when you arrive on the island, there are a wide range of taxi services in operation at the airport.

The most well-known company operating on the island is Uber, so if you have the app, you will likely be able to book a car through them. Alternatively there are a number of other Vietnamese taxi companies you can choose from such as Vina Sun, Mai Linh and Sasco.

If you arrive with a minimum amount of luggage, there are also motorbike taxi services available, with the option to rent motorbikes too for the duration of your stay.

## Things to know before traveling to Phu Quoc

**Phu Quoc Visa Exemption**

The vast majority of countries need a visa to visit most Vietnam, but Phu Quoc is the exception. The government grants citizens from all countries 30 days visa-free access to Phu Quoc island, provided you arrive by air.

You can arrive on a direct flight from other international countries, or change planes in one of Vietnam’s other major airports, as long as you plan to stay under 30 days, have six months left on your passport, and can prove you have booked the outward leg of your journey from the country before the exemption expires.

This is a big plus for travelers making Phu Quoc their sole holiday destination in Vietnam, and saves time, hassle and paperwork.
