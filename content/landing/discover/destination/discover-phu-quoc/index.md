# Phu Quoc Meaning

Phu Quoc, or Phú Quốc as it’s written in Vietnamese, refers to the island’s diverse natural environment, ‘Phú’ meaning ‘fertile land’ and ‘Quốc’ meaning nation. Its diversity is one of the reasons the island has three distinct nicknames:

Pearl Island (Đảo Ngọc), due to the abundance of pearls hidden in oysters off its coastline, which have historically been a source of prized treasure for able-bodied freedivers.

The Island of 99 Mountains, because of the multitude of mountainous terrain to be explored, from the north of the island right the way down to the south.

Emerald Island, due to the island’s lush tropical jungle that’s teeming with spectacular wildlife and adventure.

When it comes to nightlife, you’ll find a cultured selection of bars, where you can drink cocktails in comfort and enjoy island life to great conversation and fine music, as one might find in similar destinations such as the Maldives or Fiji.

# Phu Quoc Beauty

The Island is the largest of two dozen islets that make up the Phu Quoc region is the Kiên Giang Province, and is graced with an expansive 150 km of coastline sprinkled with palm trees and soft white sand beaches, surrounded by calming, crystal blue waters rich in marine life. With over 100 species of coral, plus turtles, seahorses, clown fish and bamboo sharks residing in the surrounding waters to name just a few, scuba diving or snorkeling in Phu Quoc is a real pleasure.

With the beaches, you can reside on the many graced with a slew of modern restaurants and resorts, or if you prefer to head off the beaten track, seek out a huge number of unpopulated hideaways just waiting for you to discover them.

It’s not just the coast line that harnesses the beauty, over half of the island is comprised of Phu Quoc National Park set in the Kien Giang Biosphere Reserve, a UNESCO-designated site, where you can find macaque monkeys, giant black squirrels, and vibrant spotted hornbills living among over 1000 species of tropical plants.

If you want to elevate your perspective, a series of trails such as the Ham Ninh Mountain Trek will lead you ascending up above the jungle to gaze down in wonder at the natural beauty of the region contrasted with tropical green foliage and crisp blue skies and crystal waters.

Or if you want want to expand your horizons, hopping on a boat tour transports you to some of the two dozen little islands surround Phu Quoc such as An Thoi or Hon Xuong, completely uninhabited like they’ve been lifted straight from the pages of Robinson Crusoe.

# Phu Quoc Weather

When you’re planning a trip to Phu Quoc, when to go is a question most people will ask. Happily, the Phu Quoc climate is pleasant all year round, residing between 25-35 degrees celsius, which ensures you’ll be able to enjoy a bronzing sun tan whichever month you arrive.

Vietnam has two seasons–wet and dry–and when it comes to rainfall, the months between November to May are when it’s at its lowest outside of the monsoon season.

Thankfully, consistently low levels of humidity mean you’ll enjoy a more refreshing environment to relax, whenever you get here. And if you do ever feel like you’d like to cool off, you can treat yourself to a dip in a resort’s private pool such as Green Bay’s, or cross the shoreline and paddle into the island’s breathtaking open waters. It’s all for the taking.
