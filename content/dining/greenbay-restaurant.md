In the heart of the resort and set in an open-air pavilion, boasting sweeping sea views, our main restaurant, Green Bay Restaurant is the perfect space for an exquisite meal at any time of day. Walking around the resort you will see our herb gardens, vegetable gardens and rice paddies that allow us to deliver a farm -to-table approach, wherever possible.

Each day begins with a sumptuous breakfast buffet with a vast array of fresh fruit, homemade breads, pastries and much more, including delicious homemade Vietnamese noodle soups and a station, where our Chefs will gladly whip up pancakes or eggs any style you like
